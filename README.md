# Layouts

Extra Practice for HTML and CSS 

I learned/expanded my knowledge on the following topics with these exercises:
- **Grid**
    - First time working with Grid
    - Learned how to use:
        - `grid-template-areas`
        - `grid-template-rows`
        - `grid-template-columns`
        - `grid-area`

The following photos were used as reference:
